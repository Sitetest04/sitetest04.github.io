                Full name
                Email address
                Telephone number
                Country of residence (for billing and compliance)
                1.2 Website Usage & Technical Data
                Collected automatically via cookies and analytics tools when you use our site:
                IP address and browser/device data
                Operating system and screen resolution
                Visit duration, pages viewed, and referring URLs
                Session cookies, authentication tokens, and language preferences
                1.3 Webinar & Engagement Data

                Notification and subscription preferences
                2. How We Use Your Data
                Your data is used strictly for legitimate purposes aligned with delivering a high-quality learning experience:
                Registering you for selected webinars
                Sending pre- and post-session materials, certificates, and reminders
                Customising learning paths based on your interests and role
                Providing technical and content-related support
                Improving our platform’s functionality, performance, and security
                Sharing occasional newsletters or event invites if you’ve opted in
                We do not engage in automated profiling or decision-making without human input.
                3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Access
                We do not sell or trade your personal data. We may share it with trusted third parties under strictly controlled conditions:
                Payment processors to facilitate transactions
                Webinar platforms and cloud services (e.g. Zoom, AWS)
                CRM and email systems — only if you’ve given consent
                Legal authorities when required under Polish or EU law
                All our partners are GDPR-compliant and contractually bound to maintain data confidentiality.
                4. Data Security and Retention
                We take data security seriously. Our safeguards include:
                Encrypted data storage and transfer protocols
                Access controls and authentication systems
                Continuous monitoring and security patching
                Regular data protection audits
                Your data will be stored on secure servers within the European Economic Area (EEA) and retained only as long as necessary for educational, legal, or contractual reasons — or until you request deletion.
                5. Your GDPR Rights
